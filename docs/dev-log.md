## 2026-04-25 — Step: Foundation Audit 001 — Now-Risk Fixes

### Why this step
- Foundation audit (see `docs/audits/foundation-audit-001.md`) flagged eight "fix now" risks that, if left, would force expensive rewrites the moment a second engine, a persistence adapter, or a second feature UI lands.
- Goal: resolve every "now" item with the smallest clean change, with zero new product features.

### Risks resolved in this pass
- R1: WizardFile import/export logic moved out of `WizardBuilder.tsx` into `src/core/io/wizard-file-io.ts` (pure functions + injectable browser env).
- R2 + R10: All stores now expose `subscribe(listener)` + `getSnapshot()` and async mutators returning `Promise<void>`. Common shape lives in `src/core/storage/observable-store.ts`. `WizardBuilder.tsx` now consumes via `useSyncExternalStore`.
- R3: `NormalizedPage`, `GeometryFile`, `StructuralModel`, `ExtractionResult` now declare `schema` + `version` and export runtime guards (`isNormalizedPage`, `isGeometryFile`, `isStructuralModel`, `isExtractionResult`).
- R4: Canonical `Engine<TInput, TOutput>` interface added at `src/core/engines/engine.ts`. All future engine modules must implement it.
- R5: Feature UIs relocated from `src/core/ui/<feature>/` to `src/features/<feature>/ui/`. `core/ui/` now only holds primitives, layout, and styles. Reserved `extraction-preview` and `config-viewport` slots moved with it.
- R6: Stub runners added: `localization-runner.ts`, `ocr-runner.ts`, `confidence-runner.ts`. Architecture doc now codifies the rule: engines are pure, composition lives only in `runtime/`.
- R8: Vitest wired (`vitest.config.ts`, `npm test`). One test per `is<Type>` guard lives in `tests/unit/contracts.test.ts`.

### Risks intentionally deferred
- R7: Vite `base` env handling. Current behavior is correct under GitHub Actions; documented for later.
- R9: `src/demo/sample-wizard.ts` reference. Will move to `tests/fixtures/` or wire to an "Insert sample" action when that work is needed.

### Boundaries preserved
- No extraction features added.
- No OCR, OpenCV, or PDF processing added.
- No new product UI added.
- No runtime composition implemented; all runners still throw `not implemented in foundation phase`.

### Files created
- `src/core/contracts/normalized-page.ts` (rewritten with schema/version/guard)
- `src/core/contracts/geometry.ts` (rewritten with schema/version/guard)
- `src/core/contracts/structural-model.ts` (rewritten with schema/version/guard)
- `src/core/contracts/extraction-result.ts` (rewritten with schema/version/guard)
- `src/core/engines/engine.ts`
- `src/core/io/wizard-file-io.ts`
- `src/core/runtime/localization-runner.ts`
- `src/core/runtime/ocr-runner.ts`
- `src/core/runtime/confidence-runner.ts`
- `src/core/storage/observable-store.ts`
- `src/features/wizard-builder/ui/WizardBuilder.tsx` (moved + refactored)
- `src/features/wizard-builder/ui/wizard-builder.css` (moved)
- `src/features/extraction-preview/ui/.gitkeep` (moved)
- `src/features/config-viewport/ui/.gitkeep` (moved)
- `tests/unit/contracts.test.ts`
- `vitest.config.ts`
- `docs/audits/foundation-audit-001.md`

### Files modified
- `src/core/storage/wizard-store.ts` (async + observable)
- `src/core/storage/geometry-store.ts` (async + observable)
- `src/core/storage/structural-store.ts` (async + observable)
- `src/core/storage/wizard-builder-store.ts` (async + observable)
- `src/app/pages/WizardBuilderPage.tsx` (import path)
- `package.json` (vitest devDep + `test` script)
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/dev-log.md`

### Recommended next step
- Wire the Wizard Builder save flow to `WizardStore.save` (now async + observable) so the dashboard can list saved wizards via `useSyncExternalStore`. Done as a UI-only / store-only change with no engine work.

## 2026-04-25 — Step: App Shell + UI Layer Audit/Fix

### Why this step
- The deployed GitHub Pages URL rendered as a blank white screen.
- UI styling and component structure were coupled directly inside feature files.
- We needed a visible shell and reusable visual layer without touching extraction/runtime logic.

### Root cause diagnosed
- GitHub Pages path resolution could break when build `base` did not match project-page repository paths.
- The app had no explicit shell-level visibility guarantees or mount-point diagnostics.

### What changed
- Added a visible app shell (`AppShell`) and dashboard (`HomeDashboardPage`) to ensure the app always renders clear content.
- Added centralized UI token and global style layers:
  - `src/core/ui/styles/tokens.css`
  - `src/core/ui/styles/global.css`
- Added reusable UI primitives:
  - `src/core/ui/components/Button.tsx`
  - `src/core/ui/components/Input.tsx`
  - `src/core/ui/components/Panel.tsx`
  - `src/core/ui/components/Section.tsx`
- Refactored Wizard Builder UI to consume shared components and feature-local CSS (`wizard-builder.css`).
- Updated Vite base handling to derive GitHub Pages repo path from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` when present.
- Added `#root` mount check in `main.tsx` for easier diagnosis if app shell cannot mount.

### Boundaries preserved
- No extraction features added.
- No OCR, OpenCV, or PDF processing added.
- Wizard/business logic remained in contracts + store modules.
